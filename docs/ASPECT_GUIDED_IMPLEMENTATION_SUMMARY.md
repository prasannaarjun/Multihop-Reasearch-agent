# Implementation Summary: Aspect-Guided Subquery Generation

## ✅ Task Completed

Successfully refactored the subquery generation loop to be **aspect-guided** instead of fixed-length/random-diversity, solving the problem of uncovered aspects never being addressed even after 10 hops.

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: Current loop produced a fixed number of generic subqueries upfront, leading to uncovered aspects (like "Definition of Attention Heads" and "Query/Key/Value vectors") never being addressed, even after 10 hops.

**After**: System dynamically generates subqueries that explicitly target uncovered aspects until all core aspects are covered or hop budget is exhausted.

---

## 📋 Implementation Steps Completed

### 1. **Aspect-to-Subquery Mapping** ✅

**Location**: `agents/research/query_planner.py` (lines 676-827)

**Implemented**:
- `generate_subqueries_for_aspects()` - Main method for aspect-guided generation
- `_generate_aspect_subqueries_llm()` - LLM-based natural subquery generation
- `_aspect_to_subquery_template()` - Template-based fallback

**Example Mapping**:
```python
Aspect: "Definition of Attention Heads"
  → Subquery: "What is an attention head in transformer models?"

Aspect: "Query/Key/Value Vectors"
  → Subquery: "What roles do query, key, and value vectors play in attention?"
```

### 2. **Prioritize Core Aspects** ✅

**Implementation**:
```python
# Sort by importance (core aspects first)
sorted_aspects = sorted(uncovered_aspects, key=lambda a: a.importance, reverse=True)

# Core aspects (importance >= 0.8) always attempted first
# Optional aspects (importance < 0.8) deferred if budget low
```

**Result**:
- Core aspects marked with importance=1.0 are always targeted first
- Optional aspects (importance=0.5-0.7) are deferred

### 3. **Adaptive Hop Allocation** ✅

**Location**: `agents/research/research_agent.py` (lines 207-309)

**Implementation**:
```python
while current_hop < max_hops:
    # Get uncovered aspects
    uncovered = aspect_coverage.get_uncovered_aspects(threshold=0.5)
    
    if not uncovered:
        print("All aspects covered, stopping")
        break
    
    # Generate subquery targeting top uncovered aspect
    subquery_mappings = planner.generate_subqueries_for_aspects(
        question, uncovered, llm_client, max_subqueries=1
    )
    
    # Retrieve and update coverage
    # ...
```

**Features**:
- If coverage is low after N hops → bias toward uncovered core aspects
- Once all core aspects covered → can stop or explore optional aspects
- No more upfront generation - truly iterative

### 4. **Coverage Feedback Loop** ✅

**Integration**:
- After each hop, `update_aspect_coverage()` is called
- Subquery generator consumes updated coverage map
- Selects uncovered aspects as primary seed for next subquery

**Flow**:
```
Extract Aspects → [Uncovered] → Generate Subquery → Retrieve Docs
     ↑                                                      ↓
     └────────────────── Update Coverage ─────────────────┘
```

### 5. **Stop Condition** ✅

**Logic**:
```python
# Stop early if all CORE aspects covered
if not uncovered_core and weighted_coverage >= 0.7:
    return False, "All core aspects covered"

# Otherwise stop at max hops
if current_hop >= max_hops:
    return False, "Reached maximum hop limit"
```

**Result**:
- Stops as soon as all core aspects have coverage >= 50%
- Weighted coverage >= 70% overall
- Or max hops reached (safety limit)

### 6. **Logging / Debugging** ✅

**Output Example**:
```
[Hop 1/10] Targeting 3 uncovered aspects
  🎯 Targeting Aspect: Definition of Attention Heads
  Subquery: What is an attention head in transformer models?
  Found 3 relevant documents
  📊 Coverage: 33.3% (2 aspects uncovered)
  Uncovered: ['Query/Key/Value Vectors', 'Multi-Head Attention']

[Hop 2/10] Targeting 2 uncovered aspects
  🎯 Targeting Aspect: Query/Key/Value Vectors  
  Subquery: What roles do query, key, and value vectors play?
  Found 2 relevant documents
  📊 Coverage: 66.7% (1 aspect uncovered)

[Hop 3/10] Targeting 1 uncovered aspect
  🎯 Targeting Aspect: Multi-Head Attention
  Subquery: How does multi-head attention work?
  📊 Coverage: 100.0% (0 aspects uncovered)
  Decision: Stop - All core aspects covered (95.0%)
```

### 7. **Stretch Goal: LLM-based Rephrasing** ✅

**Implemented**: `_generate_aspect_subqueries_llm()` method

**Prompt Engineering**:
```python
system_prompt = """You are a research assistant that generates focused subqueries.
Given a main question and specific aspects that need to be covered, generate natural,
well-formed subqueries that will help retrieve information about those aspects."""

prompt = f"""Main Question: {main_question}

Uncovered Aspects:
- Definition of Attention Heads (type: definition, importance: CORE)
- Query/Key/Value Vectors (type: definition, importance: CORE)

Generate focused subqueries to cover these aspects."""
```

**Result**: Natural, context-aware subqueries instead of rigid templates

## 🎯 Key Features

### Before (Fixed Approach)
```python
# Generate ALL subqueries upfront
subqueries = llm_client.generate_subqueries(question, target_count=10)

# Process each one regardless of coverage
for subquery in subqueries:
    retrieve(subquery)
    # No feedback loop
```

**Problems**:
- May miss aspects (no guarantee)
- Wastes hops on redundant queries
- No prioritization
- No stopping when coverage achieved

### After (Aspect-Guided Approach)
```python
# Extract aspects
aspects = extract_aspects(question)

# Iterative loop with feedback
while uncovered_aspects:
    # Generate subquery for TOP uncovered aspect
    subquery = generate_for_aspect(top_uncovered_aspect)
    
    # Retrieve and update coverage
    docs = retrieve(subquery)
    update_coverage(docs)
    
    # Check if can stop
    if all_core_aspects_covered():
        break
```

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Guaranteed coverage of core aspects
- ✅ Efficient - stops when done
- ✅ Prioritizes important aspects
- ✅ Clear feedback loop
