# Implementation Summary: Aspect-Based Coverage Tracking

## ‚úÖ Task Completed

Successfully enhanced the multihop subquery generation loop with a **coverage-check layer** that ensures all aspects of a user's query are addressed before stopping.

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Before**: The research agent would stop early if it found high-quality documents, even when the question had multiple facets (e.g., "self-attention vs. multi-attention"), potentially causing incomplete answers.

**After**: The system identifies all aspects of a query, tracks their coverage across hops, and only stops when all core aspects are adequately covered or max-hop limit is reached.

## üìã Implementation Details

### 1. **Aspect Extraction** ‚úÖ

Added functionality to break queries into facets/sub-aspects:

- **LLM-based extraction** (preferred): Uses LLM to intelligently identify aspects with structured output
- **Heuristic-based extraction** (fallback): Uses regex patterns for comparison, definition, process, causal, evaluation, and application aspects
- **Importance weighting**: Aspects marked as "core" (1.0) or "optional" (0.5-0.7)
- **Keyword association**: Each aspect has keywords for document matching

**Files Modified:**
- `agents/research/query_planner.py` (lines 35-86, 386-596)

**Example:**
```
Query: "self-attention vs multi-head attention"

Identified Aspects:
1. [CORE] Definition of self-attention (importance: 1.0)
2. [CORE] Definition of multi-head attention (importance: 1.0)
3. [CORE] Comparison between mechanisms (importance: 1.0)
```

### 2. **Coverage Tracking** ‚úÖ

Implemented comprehensive coverage tracking:

- **AspectCoverage dataclass**: Tracks coverage scores for each aspect
- **Document scoring**: Each retrieved document is scored against all aspects based on keyword matches
- **Coverage metrics**: Overall coverage %, weighted coverage (by importance)
- **Hop tracking**: Records which hop first covered each aspect

**Files Modified:**
- `agents/research/query_planner.py` (lines 44-85, 598-636)

**Example:**
```
Coverage after Hop 1:
  ‚úÖ Definition of self-attention: 85%
  ‚è≥ Definition of multi-head: 15%
  ‚è≥ Comparison: 10%

Overall: 36.7% (2 aspects uncovered)
```

### 3. **Enhanced Stopping Condition** ‚úÖ

Updated `should_continue_retrieval` to check aspect coverage:

**Priority Order:**
1. **Max hops**: Stop if reached (safety limit)
2. **Min hops**: Continue if below (quality assurance)
3. **Aspect coverage**: 
   - Stop if all core aspects covered (‚â•70% weighted coverage)
   - Continue if core aspects uncovered
   - Continue if weighted coverage < 70%
4. **Fallback**: Traditional document-quality stopping

**Files Modified:**
- `agents/research/query_planner.py` (lines 317-394)

**Example:**
```
[Hop 3] Decision: Stop
Reason: All core aspects covered (weighted coverage: 95.0%)
```

### 4. **Integration with ResearchAgent** ‚úÖ

Updated the iterative research flow:

- Extract aspects at start of research
- Display identified aspects to user
- Update coverage after each hop
- Show coverage progress at each hop
- Pass aspect coverage to stopping decision
- Include coverage metadata in results

**Files Modified:**
- `agents/research/research_agent.py` (lines 178-337)

**Example Output:**
```
üìã Identified Aspects (3):
  1. [CORE] Definition of self-attention (definition)
  2. [CORE] Definition of multi-attention (definition)
  3. [CORE] Comparison between mechanisms (comparison)

[Hop 1] Subquery: What is self-attention?
  Found 3 relevant documents
  üìä Coverage: 33.3% (2 aspects uncovered)
  Decision: Continue - Core aspects still uncovered
```

### 5. **Comprehensive Logging** ‚úÖ

Added detailed logging at each stage:

- Aspect identification logging
- Coverage status logging at each hop
- Stopping decision reasoning
- Final coverage summary

**Example Logs:**
```
INFO: Extracted 3 aspects using LLM
INFO: Coverage status at hop 2:
INFO:   Overall coverage: 66.7%
INFO:   Weighted coverage: 63.3%
INFO:   Uncovered aspects: 1/3
INFO: Aspect 'Comparison between mechanisms' covered at hop 3 (score: 0.87)
```

### 6. **Backward Compatibility** ‚úÖ

Ensured full backward compatibility:

- Aspect coverage enabled by default but can be disabled
- Fallback to traditional stopping when coverage not available
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- LLM client optional (uses heuristics as fallback)

**Configuration:**
```python
# Enable (default)
planner = QueryPlanner(enable_aspect_coverage=True)

# Disable (use traditional stopping)
planner = QueryPlanner(enable_aspect_coverage=False)
```

## üß™ Testing

## üöÄ Usage Example

```python
from agents.research.research_agent import ResearchAgent
from ollama_client import OllamaClient

# Initialize agent (aspect coverage enabled by default)
agent = ResearchAgent(
    retriever=retriever,
    llm_client=OllamaClient(),
    adaptive_mode=True,
    min_hops=3,
    max_hops=10
)

# Process a multi-faceted query
result = agent.process("Compare self-attention vs multi-head attention")

# View coverage information
print(f"Aspects identified: {result.metadata['aspect_coverage']['total_aspects']}")
print(f"Coverage achieved: {result.metadata['aspect_coverage']['weighted_coverage']:.1%}")

# Example output:
# üìã Identified Aspects (3):
#   1. [CORE] Definition of self-attention
#   2. [CORE] Definition of multi-head attention
#   3. [CORE] Comparison between mechanisms
#
# [Hop 1-3 processing...]
#
# ‚úì Stopping early after 3 hops: All core aspects covered (weighted coverage: 95.0%)
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **Completeness**: Ensures all aspects of complex queries are addressed
2. **Efficiency**: Stops as soon as all aspects are covered (not arbitrary hop count)
3. **Quality**: min_hops enforcement prevents premature stopping
4. **Transparency**: Detailed logging shows what's covered and when
5. **Flexibility**: LLM or heuristic extraction, can be disabled
6. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work

## ‚úÖ Requirements Met

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Aspect extraction | ‚úÖ | LLM + heuristic methods |
| Coverage tracking | ‚úÖ | AspectCoverage dataclass with scoring |
