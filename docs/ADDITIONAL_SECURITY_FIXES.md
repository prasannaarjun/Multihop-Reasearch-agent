# Additional Security Fixes - Information Disclosure

## Overview

Additional information disclosure vulnerabilities were identified and fixed after the initial security audit.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixed: Unprotected Endpoints

### Issue Description

**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM  
**Type:** Information Disclosure  
**Date:** October 4, 2025

Three endpoints were publicly accessible without authentication, exposing sensitive system information:

1. `/models` - Exposed available LLM models and Ollama configuration
2. `/supported-file-types` - Revealed accepted file types and size limits
3. `/` and `/health` - Exposed database type and internal system state

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Protected `/models` Endpoint

**Before:**
```python
@app.get("/models")
async def get_available_models():
    """Get list of available models from Ollama."""
    # No authentication required
```

**After:**
```python
@app.get("/models")
async def get_available_models(
    current_user: TokenData = Depends(get_current_active_user)
):
    """
    Get list of available models from Ollama (authentication required).
    
    Requires:
        User authentication
    """
```

**Why this matters:**
- ‚úÖ Prevents attackers from enumerating available LLM models
- ‚úÖ Hides Ollama configuration and availability
- ‚úÖ Reduces information useful for targeted attacks

---

### 2. Protected `/supported-file-types` Endpoint

**Before:**
```python
@app.get("/supported-file-types")
async def get_supported_file_types():
    """Get list of supported file types for upload."""
    # No authentication required
```

**After:**
```python
@app.get("/supported-file-types")
async def get_supported_file_types(
    current_user: TokenData = Depends(get_current_active_user)
):
    """
    Get list of supported file types for upload (authentication required).
    
    Requires:
        User authentication
    """
```

**Why this matters:**
- ‚úÖ Prevents attackers from learning what file types are accepted
- ‚úÖ Hides upload size limits from unauthorized users
- ‚úÖ Reduces attack surface by limiting information exposure

---

### 3. Reduced Information in `/health` Endpoint

**Before:**
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Health check endpoint."""
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "agent_initialized": embedding_model is not None,
        "embedding_model_initialized": embedding_model is not None,
        "database_type": "Postgres + pgvector"  # Information disclosure!
    }
```

**After:**
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """
    Health check endpoint for monitoring and load balancers.
    Minimal information to prevent information disclosure.
    """
    return {
        "status": "healthy"
    }
```

**Why this matters:**
- ‚úÖ Health checks remain public for monitoring/load balancers
- ‚úÖ No longer exposes database technology
- ‚úÖ No longer exposes internal system state
- ‚úÖ Follows security best practice: minimal health check responses

---

### 4. Reduced Information in `/` Root Endpoint

**Before:**
```python
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    """Serve React app or API information."""
    if os.path.exists("frontend/build/index.html"):
        return FileResponse("frontend/build/index.html")
    return {
        "message": "Multi-hop Research Agent API",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "status": "running",
        "embedding_model_initialized": embedding_model is not None,  # Information disclosure!
        "database_type": "Postgres + pgvector"  # Information disclosure!
    }
```

**After:**
```python
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    """Serve React app or API information."""
    if os.path.exists("frontend/build/index.html"):
        return FileResponse("frontend/build/index.html")
    # Minimal info to prevent information disclosure
    return {
        "message": "Multi-hop Research Agent API",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "status": "running"
    }
```

**Why this matters:**
- ‚úÖ Root endpoint serves React app normally
- ‚úÖ API info response no longer leaks internal state
- ‚úÖ No database technology disclosure
- ‚úÖ Minimal version info for service discovery

---

## Security Impact

### Information Disclosure Prevention

**Before:**
- ‚ùå Attackers could enumerate available LLM models
- ‚ùå File upload limits and types were public knowledge
- ‚ùå Database technology (Postgres + pgvector) was exposed
- ‚ùå Internal system state was visible
- ‚ùå Embedding model initialization status was exposed

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Model information requires authentication
- ‚úÖ File type information requires authentication
- ‚úÖ Database technology is hidden
- ‚úÖ Internal system state is hidden
- ‚úÖ Minimal public information exposure

### Attack Surface Reduction

By requiring authentication for system information endpoints, we've:
- ‚úÖ Reduced reconnaissance opportunities for attackers
- ‚úÖ Made targeted attacks more difficult
- ‚úÖ Protected configuration details
- ‚úÖ Limited information useful for exploit development

---

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `app.py` | Added authentication to `/models` endpoint |
| `app.py` | Added authentication to `/supported-file-types` endpoint |
| `app.py` | Reduced information in `/health` endpoint |
| `app.py` | Reduced information in `/` root endpoint |

---

## Testing

### Manual Verification

1. **Test `/models` endpoint without auth:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/models
   ```
   **Expected:** 401 Unauthorized

2. **Test `/models` endpoint with auth:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/models
   ```
   **Expected:** 200 OK with model list

3. **Test `/supported-file-types` without auth:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/supported-file-types
   ```
   **Expected:** 401 Unauthorized

4. **Test `/health` endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```
   **Expected:** `{"status": "healthy"}` (minimal response)

5. **Test `/` endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/
   ```
   **Expected:** React app or minimal API info (no database/model info)

---

## Deployment

No additional steps needed. Changes are in `app.py` which will auto-reload if you're running with `reload=True`.

If not running with auto-reload:
```bash
# Windows with virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
python app.py
```

---

## Best Practices Followed

### Information Disclosure Prevention
‚úÖ Minimize information in public endpoints  
‚úÖ Require authentication for system information  
‚úÖ Keep health checks minimal (status only)  
‚úÖ Don't expose technology stack details  
‚úÖ Hide internal system state  

### Security by Obscurity (Defense in Depth)
While "security by obscurity" shouldn't be the only defense, hiding system details:
- Makes reconnaissance harder for attackers
- Increases the effort required for targeted attacks
- Reduces information useful for exploit development
- Complements other security measures

---

## Summary

### Endpoints Protected
- ‚úÖ `/models` - Now requires user authentication
- ‚úÖ `/supported-file-types` - Now requires user authentication

### Information Reduced
- ‚úÖ `/health` - Minimal response (status only)
- ‚úÖ `/` - No database/model information exposed

### Security Improvements
- ‚úÖ Reduced attack surface
- ‚úÖ Limited reconnaissance opportunities
- ‚úÖ Protected system configuration
- ‚úÖ Followed security best practices
