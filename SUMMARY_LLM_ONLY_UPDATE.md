# Summary: LLM-Only Subquery Generation

## ✅ Changes Completed

Successfully updated the multihop research agent to use **pure LLM-based subquery generation**, removing all regex pattern matching.

### Files Modified

1. **`agents/research/query_planner.py`**
   - ❌ Removed: Pattern dictionaries with regex templates
   - ❌ Removed: `_generate_additional_subqueries()` method
   - ✅ Updated: `generate_subqueries()` now requires LLM client
   - ✅ Kept: Complexity analysis (still valuable)

2. **`agents/research/research_agent.py`**
   - ✅ Updated: Both batch and iterative modes now require LLM
   - ✅ Added: Error when LLM client not provided
   - ✅ Updated: Passes `target_count` to LLM based on complexity

3. **`ollama_client.py`**
   - ✅ Updated: `generate_subqueries()` accepts `target_count`
   - ✅ Improved: Better prompt for focused subqueries
   - ✅ Added: Cleaning of LLM output (removes numbering)
   - ✅ Added: Fallback when LLM returns too few results

### Key Changes

**Before:**
```python
# Regex patterns
self.patterns = {
    r'what is|what are|define': [...],
    r'how does|how do|how to': [...],
    # ... many more patterns
}

# Template-based generation
for pattern, templates in self.patterns.items():
    if re.search(pattern, question):
        # Generate from templates
```

**After:**
```python
# Pure LLM generation
subqueries = llm_client.generate_subqueries(
    question, 
    target_count=complexity.estimated_hops
)
```

### Dev Settings Applied

As requested:
- **Simple questions** → 3 subqueries (complexity < 0.2)
- **Medium questions** → 7 subqueries (complexity 0.4-0.6)
- **Hard questions** → 10 subqueries (complexity > 0.8)

Default `min_hops=3`, `max_hops=10`

### Breaking Change

⚠️ **LLM client is now required** - the system will raise an error if you try to use it without an LLM:

```python
# OLD - No longer works
agent = ResearchAgent(retriever, use_llm=False)

# NEW - Required
llm_client = OllamaClient()
agent = ResearchAgent(retriever, llm_client=llm_client)
```

### Benefits

1. **Higher Quality**: LLM understands context, generates better subqueries
2. **More Flexible**: No rigid templates, works with any question
3. **Simpler Code**: ~100 lines of regex removed
4. **Smarter Results**: Complementary subqueries that cover different aspects
5. **Easier Maintenance**: No pattern dictionaries to update

### Usage Example

```python
from agents.research import ResearchAgent
from ollama_client import OllamaClient

# Initialize with LLM (required)
llm_client = OllamaClient()
agent = ResearchAgent(
    retriever,
    llm_client=llm_client,
    use_llm=True,
    min_hops=3,
    max_hops=10
)

# Process a question
result = agent.process("How does machine learning work in healthcare?")

# Check what was generated
print(f"Complexity: {result.metadata['complexity_score']:.2f}")
print(f"Target: {result.metadata['estimated_hops']} subqueries")
print(f"Generated: {len(result.subqueries)} subqueries")

for sq in result.subqueries:
    print(f"  - {sq.subquery}")
```

### Example Output

**Simple Question (3 subqueries):**
```
Q: "What is Python?"
Complexity: 0.0
→ 3 subqueries generated by LLM
```

**Medium Question (7 subqueries):**
```
Q: "How does machine learning work in healthcare?"
Complexity: 0.5
→ 7 subqueries generated by LLM
```

**Complex Question (10 subqueries):**
```
Q: "Compare supervised vs unsupervised learning across domains"
Complexity: 1.0
→ 10 subqueries generated by LLM
```

### Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `LLM_BASED_SUBQUERY_UPDATE.md` - Full technical details
- `SUMMARY_LLM_ONLY_UPDATE.md` - This summary

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
2. ✅ Pull a model if needed: `ollama pull mistral`
3. ✅ Update any code that doesn't provide LLM client
4. ✅ Test with real questions

### Testing

The system still works with all the adaptive features:
- ✅ Complexity analysis
- ✅ Adaptive hop counts
- ✅ Subquery scoring
- ✅ Iterative retrieval
- ✅ Early stopping
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

The only change is the **source** of subqueries: now always from LLM instead of regex patterns.
