# Adaptive Subquery Generation - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the multihop reasoning pipeline's subquery generation logic. The system now uses **adaptive, iterative subquery generation** that dynamically determines the number of subqueries based on question complexity, significantly improving efficiency and effectiveness.

## What Changed

### Before
- ❌ Fixed number of subqueries (always 2-5) regardless of question complexity
- ❌ All subqueries generated upfront (batch processing)
- ❌ No prioritization or scoring of subqueries
- ❌ Wasted resources on simple questions
- ❌ Insufficient coverage for complex questions
- ❌ No early stopping mechanism

### After
- ✅ **Adaptive subquery count** based on complexity analysis
- ✅ **Iterative retrieval** with early stopping when sufficient information is found
- ✅ **Subquery scoring** to prioritize most relevant queries
- ✅ **Complexity indicators** detect question characteristics
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** for transparency and debugging
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - existing code continues to work

---

## Key Features

### 1. Complexity Analysis

The system analyzes questions using multiple indicators:

- **Multi-aspect**: Questions with "and", "or", multiple parts
- **Comparison**: Questions asking to compare or contrast
- **Causal**: Questions about why, reasons, causes
- **Process**: Questions about how something works
- **Evaluation**: Questions about best/worst options
- **Temporal**: Questions about trends, future, history
- **Question length**: Longer questions indicate more complexity

**Example:**
```python
from agents.research.query_planner import QueryPlanner

planner = QueryPlanner(min_hops=1, max_hops=5)

# Simple question
complexity = planner.analyze_complexity("What is Python?")
# → estimated_hops: 1, complexity_score: 0.0

# Complex question
complexity = planner.analyze_complexity(
    "Compare Python and Java for web development and data science"
)
# → estimated_hops: 5, complexity_score: 1.0
```

### 2. Adaptive Subquery Generation

Subqueries are generated adaptively based on estimated complexity:

- **Simple questions** (score < 0.2): 1 subquery
- **Moderate questions** (0.2-0.4): 2 subqueries
- **Complex questions** (0.4-0.6): 3 subqueries
- **Highly complex** (0.6-0.8): 4 subqueries
- **Very complex** (>0.8): 5 subqueries (up to max_hops)

**Example:**
```python
# Adaptive mode (default)
subqueries = planner.generate_subqueries("What is AI?", adaptive=True)
# → Returns 1-2 subqueries

# Non-adaptive mode (backward compatible)
subqueries = planner.generate_subqueries("What is AI?", adaptive=False)
# → Returns 3 subqueries (default)
```

### 3. Subquery Scoring & Prioritization

Subqueries are scored based on:
- **Term overlap** with main question (70% weight)
- **Diversity** - new terms that add perspective (30% weight)

The highest-scoring subqueries are processed first.

**Example:**
```python
question = "What is machine learning?"
candidate_subqueries = [
    "what is machine learning",
    "machine learning algorithms", 
    "quantum computing basics"  # Less relevant
]

scored = planner.score_subqueries(question, candidate_subqueries)
# → Prioritized by relevance score
```

### 4. Iterative Retrieval with Early Stopping

The system can stop early when:
- ✅ Sufficient high-quality documents are found (avg score ≥ threshold)
- ✅ Maximum hop limit is reached
- ❌ Still below minimum hops → continues
- ❌ Document quality is poor → continues

**Example:**
```python
# Check if we should continue
should_continue, reason = planner.should_continue_retrieval(
    retrieved_docs=documents,
    current_hop=2,
    min_confidence_threshold=0.5
)

if not should_continue:
    print(f"Stopping: {reason}")
    # e.g., "Sufficient high-quality documents found (avg score: 0.85)"
```

### 5. Comprehensive Logging

All decisions are logged for transparency:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Automatically logs:
# - Complexity analysis results
# - Number of subqueries generated
# - Scoring results
# - Early stopping decisions
# - Reasoning for each decision
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage (Backward Compatible)

Existing code continues to work without changes:

```python
from agents.research import ResearchAgent
from agents.research import DocumentRetriever

# Create agent (old style - still works)
agent = ResearchAgent(retriever, use_llm=False)

# Process question (default: adaptive mode enabled)
result = agent.process("What is machine learning?")

print(f"Generated {len(result.subqueries)} subqueries")
print(f"Complexity: {result.metadata['complexity_score']}")
```

### Advanced Usage (Adaptive Mode)

Take full advantage of new features:

```python
# Create agent with adaptive parameters
agent = ResearchAgent(
    retriever,
    adaptive_mode=True,  # Enable adaptive features (default)
    min_hops=1,          # Minimum subqueries
    max_hops=5           # Maximum subqueries (safety limit)
)

# Process with iterative retrieval
result = agent.process(
    question="Compare Python and Java",
    per_sub_k=3,         # Docs per subquery
    iterative=True       # Use iterative mode (default if adaptive_mode=True)
)

# Check metadata
print(f"Mode: {result.metadata['mode']}")  # 'iterative' or 'batch'
print(f"Estimated hops: {result.metadata['estimated_hops']}")
print(f"Actual hops: {result.metadata['actual_hops']}")
print(f"Early stop: {result.metadata['early_stop']}")
print(f"Complexity: {result.metadata['complexity_score']}")
```

### Batch Mode (Original Behavior)

Use batch mode if you prefer the original behavior:

```python
# Disable adaptive mode
agent = ResearchAgent(retriever, adaptive_mode=False)

# Or force batch mode
result = agent.process(question, iterative=False)
```

## Performance Impact

### Efficiency Gains

Based on testing with various question types:

```

The adaptive features are enabled by default but don't break existing behavior.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

2. **Configure hop limits:**
```python
agent = ResearchAgent(
    retriever,
    min_hops=1,  # At least 1 subquery
    max_hops=5   # At most 5 subqueries
)
```

3. **Access complexity metadata:**
```python
result = agent.process(question)
complexity = result.metadata['complexity_score']
estimated = result.metadata['estimated_hops']
actual = result.metadata['actual_hops']
```

4. **Use batch mode if preferred:**
```python
result = agent.process(question, iterative=False)
```
